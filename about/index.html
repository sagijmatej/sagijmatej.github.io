          <p>Founder and Vision</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The firm was founded by Filip Vusić, an architect with extensive experience in design and project management. Filip started his career with a vision of creating spaces that reflect modern needs while respecting the context and identity of each location. His work is characterized by attention to detail, innovation, and the ability to merge functionality with aesthetics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under his leadership, F3 Architecture has become synonymous with a contemporary approach to design, emphasizing execution quality, sustainability, and the smart use of resources. Filip believes that every space carries its own story, and his mission is to find the best way to express that story through architectural forms, materials, and design.
